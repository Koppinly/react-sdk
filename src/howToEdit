Make your changes: Edit the code in your local project as needed.

Test your changes: Run your app locally to make sure everything works as expected. You can usually do this with npm start.

Commit your changes: Once you're satisfied with the changes, commit them to your local Git repository. Use the following commands in your terminal:

sh
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Replace "Your commit message" with a brief description of the changes you've made.

Push to GitHub: Push your commits to the main branch (or whichever branch you're using) of your GitHub repository:

sh
Copy code
git push origin main
Deploy to GitHub Pages: Run the deploy command:

sh
Copy code
npm run deploy
This command will build your app and push the build to the gh-pages branch of your repository. GitHub Pages will then automatically update to serve the new version of your app.

Check your live app: After deploying, it's always a good idea to visit your GitHub Pages URL to ensure the live app reflects your changes.

Remember, each time you run npm run deploy, it builds the latest version of your app from your local codebase and updates the GitHub Pages site, so your workflow is essentially a cycle of making changes, testing, committing, pushing, and deploying.
